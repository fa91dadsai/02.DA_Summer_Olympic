# Summer Olympics Data Analysis: Medal Tables 1896-2012 🏅🔍

This is the grand finale of my Summer Olympics data analysis project, where I've combined numerous data analysis concepts and techniques I've learned throughout my journey. It's not just a coding exercise; it's about interpreting and understanding complex data with real-world implications.

## The Challenge 🔑

Imagine your first day at a Data Science advisory firm. Your boss tasks you with creating the official Summer Olympic Games Medal Tables for all editions from 1896 to 2012. Your resources: a massive dataset with over 31,000 medals and official Medal Tables for 1996 and 1976 as references.

## The Goal 🚀

Minimize the divergence between your aggregated Medal Tables and the official ones. The challenge isn't just about solid coding skills; it's about "Thinking in Data Structures."

## The Score 🎯

Calculate the total absolute divergence for the 1996 and 1976 editions. The optimal score is 0. A score far from this target means your analysis is far from official records.

## The Puzzle Solved 🧩

With Python, Numpy, and Pandas, I embraced the challenge and applied my data-wrangling skills to craft the most accurate Medal Tables for every Olympic edition.
